# Squad Mortar Calculator

Squad is a modern military combat simulator which relies heavily on strategy and teamwork.

This is a work in progress for a distance finding tool. The calculator will quickly translate the alphanumerical cordinates provided from the in-game map and produce a rage, angle, and degree of measurement needed to fire artillary pieces accurately.
